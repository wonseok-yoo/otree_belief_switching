{% block content %}
    <p> You will be asked to do a similar task as in Scenario 0.</p>
    <p> <strong> Except</strong> that </p>
    <p> - The box is now yours and your payment depends on which box you have. </p>
    <p> - You will be able to <strong> swap </strong> the box if you want at the end of the <strong>5th</strong> round. </p>

    <p> You will be presented with two boxes: the <span style="color: green;">Green</span> Box and the <span style="color: red;">Red</span> Box.(As shown in the image below)</p>

    <p> - The <span style="color: green;">Green</span> Box contains 5 green balls and 4 red balls.</p>

    <p> - The <span style="color: red;">Red</span> Box has 5 red balls and 4 green balls.</p>


    <p>The computer will randomly select one of the two boxes. You will not be informed which box has been chosen, whether it is the <span style="color: green;">Green</span> Box or the <span style="color: red;">Red</span> Box.</p>

    <p>Your task is to guess the probability that the box is the Green Box and to choose either to swap or keep the box. </p>

    <p>You will be asked to tell us your best guess that the chosen box is the Green Box.</p>

    <p>Next, we will randomly draw a ball from the selected box and show it to you. Then, you will be asked to report the likelihood that you think the chosen box is the <span style="color: green;">Green</span> Box.</p>

    <p>You will draw balls for 5 rounds. After each round, you will be asked to tell us your best guess.</p>

    <p> After the 5th round, if you would like, you will be able to <strong> swap </strong> the box without any cost. </p>
